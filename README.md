# ZJU-Project-Report-Template

Typst is a new text markup language, considered the successor of LaTeX. This is yet another Zhejiang University project report template written in Typst, mainly designed for the course "Fundamentals of Data Structures (211C0020)".

## Configuration

### Theme

Currently, I have provided two themes, corresponding to common lab reports and project reports in ZJU's Computer Science courses.

### Fonts

I have configured default fallback options for serif, sans-serif, and monospace fonts, which you can modify using the `font_serif`, `font_sans_serif`, and `font_mono` arguments.

However, for better rendering experiences, font family `New Computer Modern` and `Source Han Serif SC` are preferred.
